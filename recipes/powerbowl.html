    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Quinoa: This is the bases of the bowl. Quinoa is filled with protein,
        carbs and fibre to keep you feeling full!
      </li>
      <li>Avocado: Seriously, what’s a bowl without avocado?</li>
      <li>
        Kale: For a serving of green veggies. You can use any greens you like
      </li>
      <li>Corn: For some added colour, sweetness and carbs.</li>
      <li>Chickpeas: A great source of plant-based protein and fibre</li>
      <li>Red peppers: For some crunch and flavour.</li>
      <li>Green onion: For flavour.</li>
      <li>
        Feta cheese: Another protein source in this salad. Omit for dairy-free.
      </li>
      <li>Pumpkin seeds: Can you any nuts or seeds</li>
      <li>Sesame seeds: Can use any nuts or seeds</li>
      <li>
        Fresh herbs: Basil and cilantro are used in this bowl, but any herbs you
        love will do!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the quinoa according to package directions, then prep all the
        vegetables and ingredients. (cut, crumble, slice…etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl. Add more or less of
        any ingredients you like!
      </li>
      <li>
        Top it off with homemade green goddess dressing and mix it all together.
      </li>
      <h3>Optional Suggestions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use toasted seeds in this recipe, they will give much more flavour
          than raw seeds.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you make this recipe for food prep, leave the dressing separate so
          the salad doesn’t become soggy. Dress only right before serving.
        </li>
        <li>
          When cooking the quinoa, I recommend using 1 cup of quinoa to 1 3/4
          cups water so the quinoa doesn’t become mushy.
