      I have been experimenting with different flavor combinations, and I have to
      say, this tropical smoothie recipe is our new favorite! It is full of
      tropical fruit with some coconut milk for a creamy texture and richer
      flavor. You can get all fancy with the garnishes like I did here, or
      simply serve it as is; either way it is sure to be a hit!
