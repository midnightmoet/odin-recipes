    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In 8-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add bell pepper, onion and mushrooms to oil.  Cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until onion is tender.  Stir in spinach; continue cooking and stirring just until spinach wilts.  Remove vegetables from pan to small bowl.</li>
      <li>In medium bowl, beat egg product, water, salt and pepper with fork or whisk until well mixed.  Reheat same skillet over medium-heat.  Quickly pour egg mixture into pan.  While sliding pan back and forth rapidly over heat, quickly stir with spatula to spread eggs continuously over bottom of pan as they thicken. Let stand over heat a few seconds to lightly brown bottom of omlette.  Do not overcook; omlete will continue to cook after folding.</li>
      <li>Place cooked vegetables mixture over half of omlete; top with cheese.  With spatula, fold other half of omleteover vegetables.  Gently slide out of pan onto plate.  Serve immediately.</li>
